“What’re you reading?” Judith asked, bustling around the house. 

Karl had no wish to get into an argument this time. As he got older, he found it more and more wearing. He decided not to batter at the problem, but rather to avoid it. 

“A book,” he muttered, gathering together the shreds of his patience in order to use the most neutral tone possible.

“What’s it called, that beloved literature of yours? Begins with an ‘f’...?”

“Science fiction,” he replied resignedly. 

“I knew it was some kind of fickly-fiddle-dee-dee.”

‘...ignore it ignore it ignore it ignore it ignore it...,’ he repeated without pause in his thoughts, like a mantra. He recognised that she’d asked out of spite. After all, their relationship hadn’t just begun today, so of course she already knew the answer. This wasn’t the first time they’d had a conversation on the topic.

They’d been going through a difficult period recently and only the day before he’d been wondering whether or not to end it with her. However, he’d assumed he still loved her, since he liked to sit with her sometimes and simply indulge in doing nothing at all. He couldn’t do that with anyone else. Even so, she quite often drove him mad. He did acknowledge, though, that love isn’t like a rock, enduring and everlastingly constant, but is more like a plant; it requires attention, nurture and care. So he’d decided to play the gardener.

Judith is a biblical name. The Old Testament Judith of Bethulia was described as a woman of exceeding beauty and great riches, but very religious at the same time. When the Assyrian army attacked Israel, the highest commander, Holofernes, laid siege to the city of Bethulia. All seemed to be lost, but Judith decided that she alone would defend the entire city. That evening, she prayed and then set out for the Assyrian camp, carrying only a bag holding some morsels of food and drink. She told the guards that she was fleeing the besieged city to save her life. When one of them brought her into Holofernes’ presence, the commander was immediately enamoured of the deceptively beautiful... and just as deceptively defenceless... woman and gave orders to his servants to attend on her. Holofernes planned to take Judith on the fourth day. To that end, he held a great banquet and, while the feasting was in progress, he urged her to drink copious amounts of wine. Yet, so inflamed was he that, in the end, it was he who drank himself into unconsciousness. Judith seized this opportunity... and taking up Holofernes’ own sword, she cut off his head. Then she put it in the bag which had held her food and returned to Bethulia. The next day, the commander’s head was hung from the walls of the besieged city. When the Assyrians saw it and realised what had happened... what that “one Hebrew woman” was capable of... they were seized with fear and they fled. At that, the Israelites took off in pursuit of the enemy’s troops and crushed them.

Karl had a justified suspicion that his own Judith was very familiar with this cheerful story, since time and again she’d said to him “if you piss me off, \[2I’ll cut off your fucking head\]”.

Karl preferred to avoid decapitation but, a few days later, something in particular began nagging at his thoughts. As follows; a painting had always hung on the wall in the guest room. A few smears of red on a yellow background, an object which Judith grandiloquently called ‘art’. It had hung there... until the previous Wednesday. Since then, the wall had remained empty.

Karl didn’t miss the ‘work of art’, but it had to be admitted that the daub did have a certain market value. Besides this, he was astonished that not so much as a trace had been left on the wall. The picture had hung there for years, so there really ought to be a large, lighter patch. It was most odd.

He weighed up his options. Should he \[3ask Judith about it\], risking yet another clash, or would it be better to wait until the next day and \[4talk it over with his brother\]? Perhaps Anton would know something about it.

“I don’t understand you at all,” Judith said irritably. “Sometimes you say you’re good at it and other times you complain that your writing’s a waste of space. It’s senseless.”

Karl was sitting at the table by the window and gazing out, idly watching their obese neighbour from the house opposite. She was trying to catch her Yorkshire terrier and, given the shape she was in, her efforts were commendable. However, her miniature pet had the urge to enjoy a taste of freedom and, at the same time, it was remarkably agile.

“There’s nothing contradictory about it,” he said contemptuously. “I write poorly, but everyone else is considerably worse than I am. In fact, that’s what sickens me. The books sell, so apparently I’m good, though the truth is that it’s none of my doing at all.”

“Arrogant arsehole\!” Judith’s anger was unfeigned. “You wouldn’t recognise good literature even if it stripped off its thong and sat on your face\!”

Karl recognised that this was an excellent moment to change the topic.

“Listen, I’ve been meaning to ask you something all day. What happened to your beloved daub that used to hang on the wall there?”

Judith looked at him in surprise.

“What daub? That wall’s never had anything hanging on it.”

Karl was so astonished that he had absolutely no idea how to respond.

The sound of a car horn blared out, followed by the squeal of tyres... and one more squeal... of pain and terror... almost drowning out the first. The Yorkie had run straight under the wheels of an approaching car.

Karl got up from the table.

“I’m going upstairs,” he remarked. “Maybe I’ll manage to get a bit of work done.”

\[5He’d always preferred happy endings\].

The following day, Karl was contentedly taking part in a traditional drinking session with his brother. He was planning to question him about the ‘vanishing painting’ while they were at it, although he didn’t quite know why it was bothering him so much.

They were sitting on the veranda of Anton’s house in the suburbs and sipping cognac.

“The difference between pâté with bacon and bacon with pâté needs settling once and for all.”

“Top ‘em up.”

During one of the top-ups, Karl turned to the topic of the ‘daub’, describing it in a fair amount of detail.

“But... what painting?” Anton looked genuinely surprised. “No, I don’t remember any picture. I mean, I wouldn’t forget a monstrosity like that.”

The moment of conversation left Karl completely confused. 

“I’m at an utter loss to understand how that’s possible.” He mused for a moment, then continued, speaking partly to himself. “I’m certain we’ve even got some photos of a party at our place somewhere and you can see the wall with that picture on it in them. This is probably the strangest thing that’s happened to me recently. Exactly like an antithesis to *deja vu*”. He took a large swig of his drink. “Something was there and it’s gone... Maybe space-time is collapsing,” he said with a laugh.

“I don’t know what you’re muttering about there.” Anton wasn’t convinced. “Time is time, it runs linearly. We see that every day,” he added, topping their glasses up again.

“That’s not necessarily the case. Not at all.” Karl spoke calmly, even though his brother’s irritated resistance was beginning to make itself felt... and so was the cognac he’d already drunk. It was going to his head with a vengeance now. “It could be a bit like the sun. How do we perceive it? Because of our limitations, it seems to us that the sun moves in relation to the earth... that it travels from east to west, even though that’s not what happens at all. And maybe humans’ limited perception also triggers the impression of the linearity of time, whereas, in fact, it might be a random collection of small fragments, for instance, like a mirror shattered into myriad shards, with each one containing the reflection of a part of reality. When the shards are similar to one another, that might be exactly where the impression of *déjà vu*, comes from, for example, or an automatic aversion or attraction to someone we’ve just met... or my ‘anti-*deja-vu*’...” 

He smiled to himself.

“My God, you have to give up drinking,” said Anton. “But from tomorrow.” \[5And for now, top ‘em up\].

5

The following day, Karl had little time to ponder over ‘the affair of the vanishing masterpiece’, since he had to devote himself entirely to work. The publisher’s deadline was closing in and his book was still a long way from being finished. Finally, he decided to present the publisher with a typewritten draft version in order to be able to prove that he’d undertaken some kind of activity with a view to fulfilling his contract. In general, he tried to behave honestly, not so much to meet the demands of his conscience, but more for the comfortable sense of being superior to others that it gave him. But, as he always said, “All those who are honest live short, impecunious lives, without the respect of their nearest and dearest,” adding, after a customary, and effective pause, “Short... if they’re lucky.”

He decided to go for a stroll through the town centre, a notion the sunny weather was conducive to. On such occasions, he was in the habit of eavesdropping on the conversations of passers-by. He found the sentences and phrases torn from their context fascinating.

“They came up with these smartphones,” a guy said feverishly to his corpulent friend, “and people don’t delete their text messages any more. They often save the whole correspondence... I checked recently and, over the course of the entire relationship, she and I exchanged exactly seven hundred messages. Shit\! A fucking seven-hundred-text-message romance\!”

“...don’t talk rubbish. Representative democracy is like representative eating or having representative sex,” a handsome, middle-aged blonde woman declaimed into her phone. “No. Absolutely not\! You might just as well say that, if we’re going to eliminate global warming, then we need to turn on more fridges, because then it’ll get colder. Idiot\!” She laughed, clearly amused by the reaction of the person on the other end of the call.

Karl made his way unhurriedly along a street lined with buildings on both sides, savouring the crisp morning and listening in on the products of the randomly encountered human minds. However, there came a moment when he noticed that something was wrong. The row of buildings to either side of him had unexpectedly stopped; on the spot where, only the day before, one of the town’s largest shopping centres had stood, there was now nothing but an empty, grassy square.

He started running from side to side, searching for a sign, any sign, of the previous day’s presence of the building. Nothing. Not a trace. In the initial impulse of the moment, he wanted to ask the first passer-by he came across about the phenomenon, but for some unfathomable reason he had a clear sense of what he would hear in reply. In the end, he got himself under control. After all, he couldn’t just stand there on the smooth lawn for ever.

“Excuse me...” The hot-dog seller stood here every day, on the other side of the street. He must have seen what had happened. “Where’s the shopping centre gone? Have they carried out some kind of controlled demolition? But this fast...? Where’s the rubble...?”

The hot-dog seller gazed at him with growing astonishment and animosity. He clearly had Karl down as a madman.

“Come on, mate, there ain’t never been nuffink like that ‘ere, not in all the fourteen years I been workin’ this patch. Get outta here, you’re scarin’ me customers off\!”

Once his first attack of panic had retreated, Karl realised that the time had come to make a decision. What next? How was he going to handle what was happening? What attitude was he going to take to these events? He could see two options; admit that he was, in fact, probably insane and \[6see a psychiatrist\] or recognise that, actually, something bad really was going on and \[7try to get some advice from a scientist\].

6

While he was waiting for his turn to go into the psychiatrist’s office, Karl felt impelled to have a cigarette. His feelings about the addiction were mixed, given that his father had died of cancer. ‘What’s interesting is that Father never smoked, but cancer did for him anyway, so actually, what would be the sense in avoiding tobacco,” he mused, reaching for the packet of Gauloises he kept tucked away for just such an occasion.

His father had battled with cancer for years, enjoying a relatively comfortable life. It was only in the final months that his body was suddenly ravaged; *de facto*, the disease had rendered him bedridden in the space of a week. Karl had cared for him to the very end, but it was in precisely that period that the two of them had found it difficult to establish a conversation of any length. Even during their shorter exchanges they had tried not to look at each other, but had gazed somewhere off to the side, as if the slow process of dying had pushed them both in a state of embarrassment.

Karl’s train of thought was interrupted when he was invited to go into the office. Doctor Nadia Morozova was standing with her back to the door and didn’t notice that he been admitted. Karl watched her in silence for a while as she straightened the seams of her stockings. They’d known each other for years and there’d even been a time when a deeper connection had run between them. That was nothing but history now, though. In a long-term relationship, people can begin to feel an aversion for their partner, frequently accusing them of a great many inconsequential things, quite often completely unjustly. This happens because it’s a way that lovers attempt to hide the fact that, in reality, they are angry with themselves for no longer being able to perceive that *something* in their partner which other people can still see. In other words, putting it plainly, the dog-in-the-manger syndrome raises its head. It might be that Karl and Nadia were both aware of this, since what remained of their relationship was a kind of trust, if not friendship.

In general, he did the talking and she allowed him to open up and, so far, this had worked for them.

She heard him out and then thought for a moment.

“Nonetheless, you decided to bring this to me...”

“You know how it goes. Talk to the wise and stay silent with the fools.” He smiled.

“So. You think you have a psychiatric disorder? I need to know what your inner attitude is to what’s happened to you. Are you aware that it’s completely unreal?”

“Are you asking if I’m a lunatic? I don’t know. I thought producing a diagnosis like that was more your role.” Karl laughed nervously. “There was a time when I gave some thought to this... if continually interpreting and fictionalising is a trait of the human mind, then dreams can only be attempts to interpret and fictionalise a process that has *nothing* in common with the actual experiencing of reality; the processing of the data collected during the day. I assume that, then, the mind makes use of the most distant associations possible so as to somehow bring processes diametrically remote from the brain’s ‘daytime’ workings, processes that are more reminiscent of a computer’s data processing operations than the workings of a conscious mind, into line with familiar reality. You understand what I mean. An example of a close association; the doorbell rings and, at that moment, the sleeping person dreams that someone’s ringing the doorbell, that they come in, *etcetera*. I’d say that all of us are familiar with a phenomenon like that. The sleeping mind reacts to a stimulus from the outside world. What I have in mind here is that if, in the dream, the doorbell was transformed into the sound of a church bell or a falling glass, I’d also accept that as a close association.”

“What does that have to do with your condition?” Nadia asked.

“I have the impression that a similar phenomenon could occur during a psychological illness; the damaged mind is carrying out the strangest, most reckless and even, more likely than not, completely nonsensical operations, but some part of it is still striving to interpret and fictionalise them by using mechanisms similar to the ones that come into play during sleep. Such intensive work deprives the mind of both the possibility and the time for contact with reality, so there’s either almost no contact or, quite simply, zero contact. The most distant... or, more rarely, slightly closer... associations then become the basic principle for the mind’s activity, the sick person’s route, in its own way, to the exterior world, but, at one and the same time, the therapist’s route... or key... to the patient’s interior world. However, I think that using that one route to reach the contorted mind would either be a singularly difficult task or, quite simply, an impossible one, because a person with a mind that’s working in the classical way is incapable of comprehending the trains of associative thought followed by the sick mind. In my opinion, a healthy person only uses them when they’re asleep, while we all make use of nothing but ‘close’ associations when we’re awake.”

Nadia jotted something down in the notebook lying on her desk.

“In that case, what are the distant associations like?” she asked a moment later.

“The difference here is so great that I wouldn’t even be able to give an example of a distant association, because only one of its outer limits is located in the reality we’re really familiar with. The other, after all, is situated in the unimaginable world of insanity. In other words, close associations are those where both extremities are rooted in our reality, where the principle of relevance applies... we use a few of the most characteristic features of an object in our associations. I don’t think the more remote and distant associations are grounded in that principle. Forced to fictionalise elements that are diametrically removed from reality, the sleeping or sick mind latches on to randomly selected features, almost like someone drowning clutches at a straw. It doesn’t in the least seize on those that are most typical. Because the things it’s forced to associate with have nothing, or almost nothing, in common.”

“Well, I think you should take this to a psychiatrist you haven’t fucked yet,” Madame Doctor retorted in a professional tone. She prescribed the patient some pills, recommended a month without reading science fiction and then ordered him to get out and come back if his problems recurred.

Karl had got as far as the door when he turned back to say one more thing.

“Nadia, I...”

He froze on the spot. He was alone in the office. Nadia had vanished. The furniture had vanished. The fixtures and fittings had vanished. The room was completely empty. He rushed out into the waiting room... and into the same situation. Bare walls and not a living soul.

Terrified, Karl \[8raced out of the building and into the street\]. 

7

Karl couldn’t believe that what was happening was nothing more than the product of his brain. Fortunately, the fact that he earned a living writing sci-fi meant that he was fairly well acquainted with several scholars in fields such as physics and maths, since they’d performed the role of official consultants on his books from time to time. One of them was Doctor Einarsson and he was the man Karl was now heading to see. Marching along with an energetic step, he wondered what would happen if, in addition to objects, people also started vanishing. Judith... The mere tentative heralding of that thought terrified him.

He wasn’t, perhaps, all that much of a family man. On more than one occasion, his father had said that he’d always taken care of his family and never thrown money away on drink, cards and whores. Yet, as he’d said it, what had echoed in his voice was more akin to regret than pride. Moreover, Karl believed that even a great many items of everyday use were capable of lasting longer than a modern-day relationship between a man and a woman. Stereo equipment. Shoes. Nivea cream. Within a few years, things would probably have reached the point where even fresh yogurt would last longer. Despite this, Karl was hoping that, this time, this was the genuine article. His family. He didn’t even want to think that something might happen to Judith.

Doctor Einarsson wasn’t all that old, but the degree of abnegation and neglected seediness he’d attained meant that Karl had the impression he was communing with a man well advanced in years... and one who was both malicious and aggravatingly acute, at that. He listened to the entire story and then sank into an enormous armchair upholstered in plush which had undoubtedly been red many years previously.

Finally, he spoke. “So, you believe that objects of various sizes are unexpectedly vanishing along with human memory of them,” he said slowly, tugging on a shaggy, greying beard adorning the vicinity of lips stained yellow by way of kilograms of tobacco smoked and litres of coffee drunk.

“I’m... I’m just asking...”

“A steaming pile of fucking horseshit can also occur in the interrogative,” the scholar interrupted sharply.

Karl had known him for years and was well aware of the fact that it was sometimes worth showing him a certain degree of patience. So he kept quiet and, after a moment, Einarsson did, in fact, pick up the topic again.

“Some physicists believe that the whole universe and everything we experience every day is only a holographic reflection of physical processes taking place somewhere else entirely... in a distant, two-dimensional space that’s primal in relation to ours.”

“All right, but what does that have to do with my situation?” Despite his hold on his patience, Karl was beginning to get irritated. “Scientists announce their highfalutin theories, but I’m more interested in what the implications arising from them are for everyday life and ordinary people. What the hell does hologram theory or Plato’s bloody cave have to do with the phenomena that have occurred recently? I don’t give a damn about deliberations or whether, when I wipe my backside, the original me in the original world is wiping his two-dimensional original of my rounded behind, or whether his arse is more real than mine is\!”

Einarsson smiled to himself.

“The reflections can often be imprecise,” he remarked. “They can contain defects. Anyway, it’s always fascinated me how suspiciously close the ancient thinkers were to modern science... and sometimes even to the truth in itself. Let’s take... Democritus of Andera, who developed his atomic theory of the world before Christ was ever born... Anaximander, who admitted the existence of numerous worlds emerging in parallel in the *apeiron*... in a manner disturbingly close to modern research into the laws of quantum physics, which indicate that they not only exist in parallel to our universe, but exert a mutual influence on each other, as well. I sometimes have the impression that they weren’t pioneers, but rather reality was slowly adapting itself to our imaginations and expectations... that we’re laboriously carving it out with our own minds... Maybe Earth really was flat thousands of years ago...?”

He broke off and rummaged noisily around the room in the ensuing pause before finally succeeded in his quest to light a small, blackened pipe. When he continued, his face was almost entirely veiled in smoke.

“Even if what you’ve said were true, there’s no way I could be of help to you. In order to draw the correct conclusions, I’d have to make a thorough analysis of the changes as they occur, and they... as you maintain... don’t exist from my point of view. So, besides the question ‘What the hell is going on,’ there remains one more key question. Why are you the only person who can perceive the phenomenon?”

Karl was receiving the impression that Einarsson didn’t believe him. Maybe the scientist thought that the questions he’d brought to him actually related to another sci-fi novel? Nonetheless, he’d proven helpful in one respect. Yes, indeed, it was most odd. Setting insanity aside... for what reason was Karl the only conscious observer of the events that were taking place?

Turning that thought over in his mind... \[8he set off home\].

8

On the way home, he studied his surroundings intently; he had an overpowering impression that there were fewer people around than usual. Inwardly, he was counting on the fact that it only seemed that way to him. He was also seriously concerned about Judith’s fate. Would he find her at home when he got back? What did it matter that she sometimes irritated him? Perhaps recent events had opened his eyes but, be that as it may, he now knew that he’d certainly never meet anyone else like her again. Besides, he recognised that a bit of an intellectual set-to got the blood flowing. 

“Just let her be safe and sound, God...” he thought in terror as he slowly grasped the door handle. “God, help me... and if you don’t exist, that’d be out-and-out shittiness on your part.”

“Ah\! Here you are\!” Judith opened the door to him; she’d heard him fumbling ineffectively at the lock. “I was beginning to wonder what you’d got sucked into.”

Karl wouldn’t have been able to describe the relief he felt even if he’d tried. But he didn’t. He simply pulled Judith to him and hugged her as hard as he could.

“You’re suffocating me, you lunatic\!” She laughed. “I’m glad to see you, too. Come on, come inside now.”

Over the next few days, Karl got over his recent trying experiences and did his utmost to forget about the strange events and live normally. To make the most of what he had. Previously, he probably hadn’t really realised just how important his home, his work on his succession of books, his conversations with Judith and at times, even his arguments with her, were to him.

Judith sometimes questioned him about his pursuit of fiction.

“Why do you actually need to create different stories? And when you’re not writing anything, then you’re reading again, or watching a whole heap of films, serials, series...? Is it some kind of escapism?”

Karl’s reply would invariably involve the same explanation.

“I simply believe that life’s too short. The awareness of inevitable death generates an imperative in me to prolong life by every possible means. Even if it’s only an ostensible prolongment. Writing and reading and watching are the ways I absorb other people’s lives, the fictional and the possible alike. Every story is someone’s life... and I can observe it, do you see? I can experience it together with the central character. I don’t know what awaits me after death... eternal nothingness, possibly. In comparison to that, my one brief life is definitely not nearly enough. It’s outrageously inadequate. So fiction’s my way of compensating for my forthcoming non-existence. You never know when the world’s going to end.”

Sometimes, that was enough to satisfy her and she’d walk away, bored... as she underscored with a smile... by ‘the sad bullshitting of an unfulfilled intellectual’. But there were also times when she took up the topic.

“I think the same thing applies to history, you know... as the knowledge of it in the making. Look how much information we have that, perhaps, we unconsciously treat as memories of a kind. We know what happened in the Middle Ages, in antiquity... Thanks to reconstructions, documentaries and, damn it, even thanks to bullshit costume dramas and bodice rippers, we have a kind of picture of what those people looked like, of their customs and of how they spoke. Knowledge of the standards of medicine and hygiene of those times... and of the cuisine... even enables us to imagine the smell of a given era. We didn’t live then, but we have a different impression, because, after all, in this way, we’re ‘remembering’ everything. When you think about it... how vast our lives have become thanks to that. How far they extend in time\!”

“I agree. That’s the first half of the problem. Because, to use your description, we extend our lives in both directions. Yes, we’d most certainly like to *have* lived for ever, but besides that, we’d also wish eternal life for ourselves in the sense of living *from* now for all time. So, in mind, if not in body, we squeeze ourselves as far as possible into the future. Hence futurology. Hence sci-fi. They give us the sense that we know what the world will be like in the future... they ‘extend’ our lives ‘forward’. That’s why I write. Even though hardly anyone at all reads it.”

 “Don’t exaggerate. I did see what they wrote about that piece from several years back, you know... that it’s ‘a cult novel’.”

“It seems that, if you wait long enough, then even shit will obtain a noble patina. Anyway, the flourishing of a so-called cult isn’t so much the upshot of either an author’s efforts or the quality of a work; it’s more a result of the activity of the readers’ minds.”

One day, Karl was looking through some old documents, searching for his father's death certificate, but it was nowhere to be found. He phoned the register office which had issued it.

“I sorry, but I’m afraid I have no information on the matter." The clerk’s voice held an edge of suspicion that Karl was sadly all too familiar with now. “You must have the wrong branch. If anything at all had been dealt with here, there’d certainly be some trace of it.”

So, in the tenuous hope that it was, indeed, a mistake, Karl phoned the hospital which had issued the medical certificate of death.

“No. Unfortunately not.” Listening to the voice of the doctor on duty as it came through the phone, Karl mechanically envisaged a short, bald man. He started wondering if someone could sound bald. “There are no notes at all and no medical history. No one of that name has ever been treated here. Goodbye.”

After Karl had visited several other public institutions, it became clear that neither his father nor his mother had ever existed at all. There was no record of them, no documentation concerning them whatsoever. Karl felt that he couldn’t bear this much longer, that he might do himself some harm. The time had clearly come to decide whether or not to involve someone else in the matter. He knew he couldn’t cope with it alone any longer. He weighed it up in his mind. Should he \[9tell his brother everything and ask him to help\]? But maybe it would be better \[0not to risk that\]...? You never know... maybe Anton wouldn’t believe him and would take the entire story for a symptom of a serious mental illness...?

0

Karl decided not to share the burden with anyone else. He hoped he’d somehow manage to bear it, that he’d get to the bottom of this slow atrophy of reality... and maybe even prevent it. He visited a succession of scientists and delved into conspiracy theories...

Meanwhile, the streets grew deserted and the urban infrastructure disappeared. Even the topographical features of the land sank into oblivion, one after another. Hills, lakes, the nearby forest. Those people who still remained had no idea that what was around them was no more than a wretched stub of reality. In fact, that was what triggered the greatest terror in Karl. He was like someone who was afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and sinking into an ever more profound depression, yet the difference here was that it wasn’t memory after memory which was vanishing... here, it was element after element of the world.

He thought of his parents with growing frequency, particularly of his father. We don’t recollect a much-loved person who is dead as they were in their prime, in their youth, burgeoning with life and health. We’d like to, but that’s not how it works. If we were with someone like that to the end, then we’ll always remember them as weak, shrunk by disease or by age... or by both..., incapable of performing even the most straightforward of activities unaided.

And that’s when we’re lucky. Because sometimes we don’t even recall our deceased nearest and dearest as they were in life at all. For if it so happens that we’re there at their death, then that crushing sight will stay with us for ever and it overpowers, conquers and smothers the earlier, good and happy memories.

They say that the warriors of yore would rather die on the field of battle than of old age in their beds. This is ascribed to the categories of heroism and courage. Karl didn’t believe it had anything to do with either the one or the other. On the contrary. They’d simply known all too well which was the more dreadful... to die, infirm and decrepit, of old age or suddenly, in battle. So this had by no means been heroism, but a *de facto *escape.

He’d always wondered whether, if he were to meet a sudden death, in an accident, for instance, he’d die with a cry of ‘Oh, God\!’ or of ‘Fucking hell\!’ However, once he’d finally decided that he was going to go out on his own terms and avail himself of the 9 mm Luger P08 that had been in their family for generations... it turned out that \[1he went without a single word\].

9

Anton didn’t utter a word for a long moment. And then he stayed quiet a bit longer.

Finally, he spoke. “I don’t know how I’m supposed to respond to this. I mean, we’ve always been orphans. Our parents’ identities were never established.”

“That’s absurd\! They both lived to a ripe old age\!” Karl was having a serious problem with staying calm. However, he did what he could not to seem like a frenzied madman. “Father died of cancer ten years ago, two days after his eightieth birthday.”

“Have you... have you got any photos of them? Documents...? Bloody hell, man, anything at all?\!”

“No\! That’s exactly the problem\! Everything that’s connected with an object that disappears is also subject to utter disintegration, including all memory of it.”

“...but this doesn’t apply to you.”

Karl sighed resignedly.

“It doesn’t apply to me... and I don’t know why that is. I’m trying to get to the bottom of it. But I can’t take it any longer... I think I might have to shoot myself in the head. We had parents, we had a happy childhood, we lived with them until we were twenty or thereabouts... I mean, I lived with them till then, because you only moved away from Mother thirteen years later, you loser,” Karl laughed unintentionally.

“Yes, that’s me down to the ground,” Anton said, his face twisting in a cynical smile. He could see that his brother was in a wretched psychological state and he didn’t want to risk leaving him alone in his bizarre questing. “I’m not saying I believe you. But I’m not saying I won’t help you, either. One way or another, we’ll get through this together. Like we’ve got through everything else. What do you suggest we should do next, then?”

Karl heaved an evident sigh of relief. “Right now, I’m giving some thought to conspiracy and parascientific theories.” He’d clearly acquired new energy for the task. “Since rationalism’s failed me for the time being, we might as well look for answers somewhere else. It can’t hurt.”

“You could be right. Scientists are a bit like public officials. Bureaucrats have an irksome characteristic; they continually try to describe everything. Take any example you like. Works of art. I can just see a pen-pusher compiling a catalogue... or drawing up a parliamentary bill concerning the nation’s heritage... and describing Velázquez’s *Surrender of Breda* down to the very last detail. It’s kind of... dehumanising.” 

Anton thought for a moment before continuing. 

“Or, even better... Pierre Schaeffer’s *musique concrète*,” he chuckled. “Of course. There’s a multitude of works where any attempt whatsoever to describe them verbally... even a successful one... immediately distorts the work’s meaning, significance and purpose absolutely. In a case like that, a verbal description simultaneously becomes a deformation.”

Karl mused over his brother’s words for a moment. Then he took up the conversational thread.

“OK. \[AWe could talk to a group postulating the existence of the Mandela effect\]. You could say they believe that alternate realities overlap and that people unknowingly percolate between them. Something else that’d be apt are the kind of \[Bsects that believe the world is simply a computer game\]. I’ve seen their members hanging around in the streets several times, wearing cybergothic outfits and clutching weird banners. And maybe we should also look into the conspiracy theories which say that the Moon’s made of cheese.”

Anton laughed, though a touch nervously.

“I know a woman who's involved in creationist theory,” he said. Perhaps we should check whether, perchance, \[Cthe Lord God Himself isn’t punishing us\]?”

A

They made their way slowly through the town and Karl was dismayed as he assessed the extent of the decline in the structure of reality. There was almost no traffic. Pedestrians were a rarity. The buildings which still remained were intermittent. The district looked like the jaw of a man who’d been smacked hard in the face with an iron and lost every other tooth.* *

In order to distract himself and stop thinking about this, if only for a moment, Karl tackled a different topic.

“I sometimes wonder why you’re still single. If it isn’t a sensitive subject, that is? I know you’ve always got someone on the go, but never for good.”

Anton gave a lopsided smile and kicked a can lying on the street.

“I don’t know.” He hesitated. “N-o-o-o, that’s a barefaced lie. I know exactly why, but I don’t like splitting. Listen, love’s like the coccyx. It’s an atavism. An archaic, evolutionary vestige, not needed or noticed by anyone any more, and so... disappearing. It traces back to the times when a woman needed protecting, defending and security and that’s also why the tie between a woman and her partner-protector was indispensable. A tie that, in effect, also provided security to their issue and thus guaranteed the uninterrupted passing on of their genes.”

He spat on the asphalt. They walked on for a moment in silence. Finally, Anton took up the thread again.

“Doesn’t it seem to you that love’s grown shallower, that it’s contracted, become stunted? Vanished, like a superfluous organ, because women don't need protection any more... or, at any rate, that’s how it appears to them. Romantic feelings don’t really occur, while the commonplace human impulses of caring and nurturing that still remain here and there are simply met with animosity, prejudice or repugnance.”

Karl didn’t respond. He was musing over how diversely the same world could be perceived by different people.

They’d searched on the Internet and found a local group of devotees to the Mandela effect. The group’s activities were typical; meetings, lectures, film screenings and, of course, a lively presence on YouTube, as well. They had a rented room at their disposal and that very day they were giving an introductory talk for those new to the subject.

Karl and Anton came into the room and found a couple of seats. There was an audience of some dozen or so people in total and the presentation had already started. The speaker, a tall, skinny man with a shrill, squeaky voice, was holding forth.

“...and so, as you can see, the theory of which I am an adherent is primarily based on people... on the relationships between specific, living people who remember alternate facts, people who are witnesses to an alternate version of history, to a range of events... they are the walking proof of the fact that certain things occurred differently from what the official records say; they bore different names, they looked different and so forth. Someone or something introduces concrete changes into reality, sometimes major, sometime minor, but even though those changes evade the attention of most, there’s always a group of people who *do* notice. It might be that a parallel line of reality collides with ours. But it could be that someone deliberately interferes with our space-time, for example, as part of a scientific experiment. We suspect that the experiments carried out at the CERN laboratory are to blame. But one way or another, the upshot is that our reality gets mixed up with a parallel world, which causes some people to remember a version of the past that’s different from what everyone else recalls. Since you’re here today, in all likelihood most of you have noticed that some films have different scenes, or a different ending, that some products have different names, that the facts presented in the history books are out of kilter... to say nothing of the Bible.”

Once the talk was over and the audience was dispersing, the brothers managed to have a word with the skinny speaker.

“You are aware of how insane your story sounds, aren’t you?” their beanpole of a host squeaked.

‘Just look who’s talking,’ Karl thought, but he kept it to himself.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t help you,” the beanpole continued. “I don’t believe your theory. I don’t see any of the manifestations. Everything’s vanishing? Come on\! Everything’s just the same as always. N-o-o-o. What interests us are changes... geographical, factual, anatomical. Changes in nomenclature, in design, in film dialogues. Even if one recognises that a vanishing object also constitutes a kind of change... well, if it was a manifestation of the Mandela Effect, an entire group of people would unquestionably have noticed. That’s the crux of the matter.”

“Oh well, there we are. One way or another, it was worth giving it a try,” said Anton as they were leaving the building. “After listening to all that twaddle, I really can see that they’re actually involved in something that’s completely different from what brought us here. They’re two utterly different things. We’ll think about what to do next tomorrow.”

It was, indeed, now late, so they went their separate ways after \[Dagreeing to meet the following day\].

B

The sect generally handed out copious quantities of leaflets in town, which is why the area where its headquarters were located was common knowledge. As they made their way there, Karl felt disheartened and frightened, because he knew just how many injuries reality had sustained. While it seemed to him that the streets were sunnier than usual, he quickly realised that the town was quite simply missing significant swathes of its buildings. Instead of the rush-hour crush, the pavements were almost deserted. The traffic on the roads had more or less died away completely.

Anton was utterly unaware of this and strode along at a lively pace, talking about his erotic conquests.

“... so, that’s what last week was like. And the day before yesterday I met this blonde. It took me quite some time to talk that one into sex, but I won in the end. I had her, right on her kitchen table."

“Oh. Did she have anything against it?”

“Yup. The washing machine. But don't worry, I moved that out of the way first.”

Along the way, Karl threw a few coins to a beggar standing by a shop. ‘He'd better spend them quickly,’ he thought anxiously. ‘He mightn’t have much time for it now.’

“What’re you giving money to tramps for?” Anton asked in surprise. “He’ll only drink it. I don’t know. It’s like you kissed a prostitute’s hand or something of the kind.”

“May you never have first-hand experience of the fact that beggars are human beings just like you, only things didn’t work out so well for them,” Karl growled in annoyance. “You know how it goes... times of prosperity are when the criminals are living better than royalty and times of crisis are when the criminals are the only people living the good life. And by the way, if you must know, it so happens that I *have* kissed a prostitute’s hand.” 

“How come?” Anton gazed at him in astonishment.

“In the usual course of things. I left and it seemed courteous to say goodbye. A woman deserves respect. And anyway, a touch of good manners never killed anyone yet, you boor\!”

They had now arrived at their destination. There wasn’t so much as an inch of the building that wasn’t covered in graffiti. Slogans leapt out at them from the walls; ‘You are someone’s tamagotchi’, ‘Leaving the game is a deadly sin’ and the like. With thoughts of sects in mind, Karl had been expecting figures gliding around in silence, clad in habits or gauzy robes at the very least. The sight that greeted them, though, was a gaudy, vociferous rabble encamped both outside the entrance and inside. People of both sexes rocking the cybergoth look were gaming, most often on handheld devices or on computers or home consoles in the various rooms. Some were enthusiastically taking drugs in various forms and some were having sex in public.

The group’s leader welcomed the newly-arrived brothers and ordered them to call him ‘abbot’.

“...though this colourful gang call me ‘Commander of the Teutonic Order’ for a laugh," he added in amusement.

He looked completely normal; he wasn’t wearing make-up, coloured contact lenses or any kind of mask and his head wasn’t crowned by a mohican. He didn’t even have any body piercings or tattoos.... or not anywhere that was visible, at any rate.

“Sure," he continued. “The whole universe is just a computer game we’re taking part in. Actually, the word ‘just’ just doesn’t cut it. Really, I should use the phrase ‘no less than’. After all, you can do what you want in a computer game. Absolute freedom rules here, because we know that everything around us isn’t real anyway.”

Anton thought for a moment.

“Absolute freedom?” he asked. “Including... murder?”

“Of course,” said the abbot. “We believe we get extra points for frags. Besides, if you get rid of another player from the game, they still have loads of lives and, ultimately, you can also start the game again from scratch. What’s more, there’s a high likelihood that you’ll actually have got rid of an NPC. We do what we fancy... what it’s about is the game giving as much pleasure as possible. After all, that’s why we play, isn’t it?”

“Hang on,” said Karl, who was rather confused. “What’s an NPC?”

The abbot gave him a reproving look. “A non-player character, of course. Characters generated by the computer and programmed to interact with the players so as to make the game more interesting.”

“In other words... it’s a kind of... futuristic solipsism?” asked Anton.

“I’d say it’s the direct opposite. We’re not solipsists and we’re not into materialistic agnosticism, either. Solipsism says that only the observing subject is real and that reality in its entirety is simply the set of his or her own, subjective impressions, while all the people and inanimate objects encountered are, so to say, parts of the mind of the individual experiencing them. Whereas we allow for a completely different possibility... who can vouch for the fact that you or I really exist, that, actually, we’re players? Maybe we don’t really exist at all? We might be stuck here in the form of NPCs, constituting nothing more than a background for some real person-player. From what I can see, you’re both NPCs, too, your characters are so lousily put-together.” 

In the end, the abbot stated that Karl’s problem was of absolutely no interest to him and that he wasn’t going to devote any more time to non-existent people because he had to collect more game points. Concerned that this might mean they were about to become a way for him to acquire more frags, the brothers hurriedly left the building. 

It was now so late that they arranged to continue their quest the next day. \[DKarl resignedly set off home\].

C

They made their way slowly toward the restaurant where Anton had arranged for them to meet his acquaintance, Anna Koenig, who was a doctor of theology and, at one and the same time, a militant creationist.

“I’m really not convinced that this is the right track,” Karl muttered as they walked along. “You know what they say about all religious fanatics... to them, truth, understood as a description of an actual state, constitutes a personal affront.”

“It was you who said ‘since rational solutions have failed us’...”

“Yes, yes, I know. Very well, then.”

They walked on in silence for a minute. Karl was trying to assess just how many elements of reality had now been subject to dematerialisation. The town was noticeably less densely built-up than it had been only the previous day. The traffic was practically indiscernible.

Finally, Karl turned to a new topic of conversation, chiefly in order to take his mind off his growing sense of fear for a moment.

“Do you know her personally? Can you go into any detail? How does she behave? What does she look like? She’s bound to take us for lunatics.”

“Ah, well, a tall, gorgeous redhead...”

Karl gave his brother a suspicious glance.

“Not so long ago, your basic criterion for judging female beauty was ‘What a looker\! Like something out of a porn flick\!’...”

“Of course. It still is. There’s no reason to go changing an efficient system of evaluation.”

“And you’re surprised you’re still single.”

Anton shrugged.

“I’m not surprised at all. I’m not a child. I know very well that life can never compare to good cinema.”

It turned out that Anna was already waiting for them and it became clear that Anton’s description of her had been spot on, at any rate. It could even be said to have hovered on the borders of understatement.

Contrary to Karl’s fears, she heard them out with genuine interest.

“I don’t think that what’s happened to you is at all impossible or even unbelievable,” she said once they’d finished. “But then... what I’m involved in is what’s known as Young Earth Creationism. We build our theory on the basis of a biblical interpretation whereby it is evident that our planet is less than six thousand years old... or nine, at the most. Earth, humankind and all life on Earth was created by God in six days. It was then that He made the basic forms of living organisms... the ‘baramins’ or ‘created kinds’. They don’t originate from a common ancestor at all, as ridiculous evolutionary theory has it. More specifically... those baramins, those independently created *fauna *and *flora*, can change slightly under the impact of stimuli flowing from the environment, for instance, or as a result of various mutations, but only within a highly limited scope. And so I can assure you that monkeys and humans don’t have a common ancestor... not at all.” She smiled with such charm that, if Karl had been standing, his knees would have almost given way beneath him.

“In that case, how do you explain species dying out?” Anton asked. “Let’s take the classic example of the dinosaurs.”

“It’s easy to explain by global catastrophes like the biblical Flood... and similar,” Anna replied like a shot, brushing a curly lock of auburn hair away from her face with a subtle gesture which had Karl thanking his lucky stars that he was firmly seated on his chair.

“However,” she continued, “first and foremost, we maintain that the universe was created by God from nothing, in accordance with the principle of *creatio ex nihilo*. So it’s not inconceivable that, at the end of the world, the universe could return to that *nihil*. Moreover, since it was created gradually, it might also cease to exist in the same way.”

Karl and Anton immediately pricked up their ears.

“In that case, why’s the phenomenon only being perceived by one person?\!” Anton enquired.

“God is merciful. He could be shielding the fact that the Apocalypse is beginning from our eyes,” Anna responded. Then, in an unusually calm and gentle tone, she added, “Since it’s only your brother who can see the end approaching, he’s undoubtedly God’s Prophet.”

Karl experienced a sudden rush of heat. He felt that he had to get away from the table without further ado. He wanted to be alone for a minute, to gather himself together.

“Excuse me for a moment,” he said. “I must just go and powder my nose.”

He walked into the toilet, turned on the tap and immersed his hands and face in cold water. The world was spinning in front of his eyes. ‘Prophet? What fucking prophet?\!’ he thought feverishly. ‘What apocalypse?\! It’s sheer madness\!’

When he returned to the table some ten or so minutes later, Anton was sitting there alone.

“Where’s Anna? Has she left? That quickly?” Karl asked.

“Anna? What Anna?” Anton looked genuinely alarmed. “Are you feeling all right? You walked off so suddenly. I mean, we arranged to meet here to decide how to proceed. We’re going to go into the Mandela effect and the cyberpunk sect in depth. Don’t you remember?”

Without so much as a word, Karl dashed out of the restaurant and \[Dfled for home as fast as his legs would carry him\].

D

At home, Karl continued to reflect on the events of the day. A return to the consideration of scientific paths seemed essential. He knew a couple more physicists... and, in order not to be deemed a lunatic, he could present the whole affair as a story. He could tell a barefaced lie and say that he needed another series of consultations regarding one of his sci-fi books.

In the end, he concluded that he didn’t have the time for half measures and that he’d go for broke. However, rather than a brilliant theorist, he chose an excellent practitioner... Doctor Vloshin. And he lied through his teeth on the phone.

“Doctor Vloshin? It’s Karl. Yes. Could you listen... Well, no, it’s not exactly a consultation this time. Actually, think what you like, as long as you solve the problem, because what I’ve got for you today is an unusual matter, but a highly lucrative one. Please imagine a hypothetical situation where reality’s fading away for some reason. I don’t know. No, I haven’t got a clue... you’re the physicist, so I’m asking you to come up with something. Yes. It’s about urgently developing a way of connecting every single object of reality stably so as to prevent its irrevocable disintegration. And I’m leaving that to you. A model, a formula, a machine... anything. I know you’re busy, but I’ve saved the best for last... you can set your own price for the job. What? Yes. Absolutely... ask as much as you like. Of course I can afford it. Just accept that I’ve received a legacy from an aunt. That’s right. Fucking rich. OK. So I’ll be waiting for your call. Roll up your sleeves and get on to it\!”

‘I should’ve flashed a roll of banknotes at once,’ Karl thought, as he ended the call. “Even those imaginary ones. I’ll worry about paying later. But what Vloshin doesn’t know can’t hurt him. And if he fails..., \[Ethen I won’t be worrying about anything at all any more\]. 

E

Evening came. Judith still hadn’t gone to sleep. She was looking at something on the computer, lying on the bed, barefoot, wearing fairly tight-fitting jeans and a loose shirt. Karl sometimes wondered whether she dressed like that because she knew just how much the style appealed to him or if she simply did it because she was comfortable like that. Or, perhaps, for both reasons.

He was sitting in his desk chair, flanked by a small, sculpted lamp on one side and a glass and a half-empty bottle on the other. Bourbon was the only form of corn he would tolerate on the menu. He was trying to write something... anything at all... but, first and foremost, he was silently contemplating Judith. This wasn’t only because, lying there in the pool of light cast by the night lamp amidst the dimness of the room, she was material for a painting or, at the very least, an excellent photo. It was also by way of the fact that she was the last anchor securing him in a state of relative mental equilibrium.

“Hell, it’s not coming, " he muttered, glaring at the sheet of paper.

“What?” Judith asked, tearing her attention away from the computer. “I’m sorry. I didn’t catch what you said.” 

“I’m saying that it’s stupid somehow. I’m striving to digest a... recent event. I’ve called it *Trees on the Clouds*.”

“OK, go on, read it, read it,” she smiled, knowing that, as usual, this was his awkward way of seeking her help.

Karl cleared his throat and started to read, trying to convey the tone of his female narrator.

*I was making lunch when the doorbell announced that I had a visitor. It was him again. As always, he’d come to tell me what he’d dreamed about. We saw each other almost every day.*

*“... I was looking at the sky and I noticed that, in places, the clouds floating above me were covered in earth. In the sense of... soil, do you see? The wind carries earth onto the rocks, which eventually creates the conditions for plants to vegetate. Only here, it had carried it up to... the clouds.” He laughed. “They were overgrown with bushes and even with trees. It gave some of them an appearance almost like leafy, flying mountains. But I... you know how it goes in dreams... very slowly, I began to realise that, in fact, something was wrong here. I asked some passers-by, but they all claimed it was a normal phenomenon... that, of course, not only plant life, but also animals live in the clouds. I thought that, in that case, I’d come across some kind of wonder in an alternate reality.”*

*I laughed and said, “I think you’ve probably been reading a bit too much of that fantasy literature.”*

“You could well be right...” he sighed.

*Every time, his dream was an extraordinary one. Once it was a world following an invasion by aliens, another time, it was travelling to various historical epochs via a common-or-garden kitchen door. On one occasion, he even described impressions of life on a cuboid planet. Then I always wondered why some people experience such wonders as they sleep, while others dream about buying bread at the grocer’s shop. However, it was always some kind of unusual story that brought him to me.*

*And that was what our meetings were like; a time brimming with magical tales of the experiences of an intriguing man. Dream experiences.*

*One day, I noticed that he seemed somehow silent, changed in some way.*

*“Has something happened,” I asked him, alarmed. “Is everything all right?”*

*He didn’t say anything for a long moment. Finally, though, he spoke.*

*“Listen... I woke up this morning and... I’ve been walking around the town for several hours now... Looking around... And there isn’t one... there’s not even one\! I don’t know... Where have the trees in the clouds gone?*

Karl finished reading.

“What do you think?” he asked, raising his eyes from the text.

Judith wasn’t there. He stared at the immaculately made, utterly empty bed. Then he leapt to his feet and searched every room in terror, leaving a veritable shambles in his wake. There wasn’t a living soul to be seen. Judith’s clothes... her toiletries... photos of the two of them... all missing. Not a trace of her remained except the memories held in his frenzied mind.

He had absolutely no idea what to do. He searched feverishly for his mobile phone and selected Anton's number from his speed dial. ‘*The number you have dialled does not exist*. *The number you have dialled does not exist.*’ He disconnected. He didn’t have a shadow of doubt about what that meant. There was no Anton now. He fell inertly onto the bed.

\* \* \*

Almost two weeks had passed. He was drinking almost non-stop. He never went out. In fact, he barely even got out of bed. Mess and semi-darkness reigned in the house.

Loneliness undoubtedly makes itself felt differently in everyone. Karl identified it thanks to the television. In his opinion, you recognise loneliness by the fact that, when you go for a shower, you’re frightened to turn off the television as you leave the room because you’re scared of the space you’ll find when you come back later. Still and dark. Silent.

Karl never turned the television off.

First the number of programmes and presenters had diminished. And for several days now, there’d been nothing showing but the same two films.

“*...I want a nigger hidin’ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*” 

He opened another bottle, his movements unsteady, but he passed out after a few swigs. Several hours later, he woke up.

“*...I want a nigger hidin’ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*”

He struggled to his feet and, with difficulty, staggered to the toilet. The sound of a telephone ringing drifted from the room, but he was still extremely drunk, so he didn't make it back in time to answer the call. When he finally focused on the phone screen, he was astonished to discover that the caller was Doctor Vloshin. He’d left a voice message.

“Come round to my lab. I think I’m on to something....” But that was all there was. The words were followed by an explosion and a scream.

Karl collapsed into an armchair with resignation and mused at length over whether he should \[Fhead over to Vloshin’s laboratory\] or finish the bottle and not take any action... whatever it might be... until the next day. Or in a week’s time. \[GOr whenever he acknowledged that it was of any consequence whatsoever\]. 

“*...I want a nigger hidin’ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*”

F

Just in case, he took his pistol with him, which was most probably an irrational measure and gave him nothing more than an illusory sense of safety.

The land which had once been the town was now scarcely a built environment at all. It was almost completely deserted... Karl saw no more than three, perhaps four people along the way. Even though it was late morning, it wasn’t at all light. A great, dark hole gaped in the Sun and expanded with each day that passed. Maybe the Sun was too large to vanish all at once...? The Moon had ceased to exist several days before and Karl had been thinking about how this would generally be affecting the tides or the equilibrium of the Solar System. In the end, though, he’d come to the conclusion that since elements of reality were dematerialising, it wasn’t inconceivable that the laws of physics were also vanishing one after another.

He reached his destination and went into the building, now solitary, but once a part of the metropolitan sprawl. He made his way slowly along an unlit stairwell. The silence was overwhelming. He pressed down on the handle of the door to the laboratory. It was unlocked.

The room was in disarray, saturated with a whole mass of smells on a spectrum ranging from unpleasant to repulsive. Amongst them, the odour that reigned supreme was something like a combination of ozone and the stench of burned plastic.

The voice was very faint, which is why Karl didn’t hear it at all to start with. However, he knew there was another room here and from the other side of the door, which was currently hidden behind a stack of electronic scrap, came a quiet gibbering... incomprehensible words, repeated in an unbroken stream.

He shifted the pile of scrap and cautiously stepped into the room. He couldn’t see very well in the darkness that surrounded him, but he had a sense that something was wrong... some of the furniture and objects were arranged at odd angles and gave the impression of literally permeating other pieces of furniture and other items. A man was lying on the floor, covered by a filthy blanket. He was facing away from the door and he was almost completely motionless apart from the febrile movement of his lips as his faltering voice repeated the same words, over and over again. Like a incongruous counting rhyme.

Karl slowly approached him.

...glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere, glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere, glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere...” the recumbent figure gibbered without pause.

It was only after Karl had removed the blanket that it became clear that Doctor Vloshin’s experiment couldn’t be numbered amongst the successful... and that he offered no promise whatsoever of salvation. He wasn’t so much lying on the floor as inextricably integrated with it along the entire back half of his body. With his face turned upwards and his gaze utterly crazed, he was ceaselessly reciting his terrifying string of words in a voice growing steadily weaker.

Karl shot him and \[Hquickly left the lab\].

G

Karl couldn’t goad himself into any kind of action whatsoever. He was scarcely even capable of dragging himself from the bed... and he was aware of the fact that this wasn’t because he was excessively drunk. Mind you, it honestly had to be admitted that his condition was a long way from sober. He just wanted everything to be over.

The nights were the worst, because most of the stars had vanished now, while the Moon had ceased to exist the previous week. It seemed as if the universe was caving in on itself, with the centre of the collapse being the Solar System, or even Earth itself. Could what they said be true... that the universe doesn’t exist without an observer? Alcohol was hampering Karl’s thinking. For a long moment, he couldn’t recall the name of the scientist he and Vloshin had once talked about. Ah, yes, that was it... Schrödinger. Erwin Schrödinger, his fucking cat and his interpretation of the principles of quantum mechanics. Some tosh about the behaviour of elementary particles that exist simultaneously in every possible physical location. But, specifically... only until the moment when the fact of measurement or, quite simply, of observation, occurs. Only when a cognisant observer’s attention turned to those particles would this cause a given particle to assume one defined state. In Vloshin’s opinion, this meant that reality couldn’t exist without an observer, while a person cognisant of nothing would... Godlike or, at the very least, demiurge-like... summon reality into being by their cognisance and the very act of observing. Or... keep it tightly reigned in and protect it from disintegration...?

The light switch on the wall was definitely quite a distance away from Karl, but such was the darkness now that it would be difficult even to aim the bottle accurately at his mouth, let alone grope around for it on the bedside table. In the situation that had arisen, any loss of booze at all, no matter what the quantity, assumed disaster proportions, which is why Karl did, in fact, make an effort and finally managed to turn on the light. He didn’t know how his glance happened not to fall on the bedside table holding the bourbon, but on the writing desk where he kept his weapon. He slowly opened the drawer. The pistol hadn’t vanished yet; it was still lying there.

Karl took a healthy pull from the bottle... healthy enough to set his head spinning, so he collapsed onto the bed. Lying there, he recalled a daft conversation he’d had with his brother not long before.

“Do you sometimes wonder whether you've already bought your Deathbed?” Anton had asked.

“How do you mean?”

“Well, you know,” said Anton, with a chuckle, “when you buy a new bed at our age, it’s not inconceivable that it’ll last you to the end of your life.”

Karl gazed at the pistol in his hand and then \[1made his bed his Deathbed\].

H

Karl stood, helpless, in the deserted street and wondered what to do next. Everything seemed to be pointing to the fact that no one was capable of halting the annihilation. And in that case... what would happen now, what would actually remain once everything had vanished? The question fascinated Karl in a ghastly sort of fashion.

People are usually fascinated by the concept of infinity. They find it mind-boggling that anything at all could be infinite. However, infinity had recently seemed to Karl to be something safe, if not to say downright familiar. This thinking sprang from the fact that, to him, infinity stood in opposition to the concept of the oncoming nothingness he had been observing. Not nothingness in the sense of the cosmic void, though, because even in that, some particle or other might be encountered. For, after all... how could *absolutely nothing *exist?

On the whole, scientists were engaged with what fills space. Maybe they should also have interested themselves in what is found in that ‘place’ where our space is absent. The thought that the universe is infinite had never triggered fear, or even anxiety, in Karl. On the contrary... recently, that thought had seemed to calm, comfort and cheer him. He was able to comprehend a universe thus conceived of. Even if it were an infinite universe composed of smaller universes like ours. However, his hair stood on end at the very thought that, at some moment, the continuum of things would come to an end and that there was absolutely nothing beyond it. So what would that *absolute *void be? How was it going to be located beyond the world of things if that world actually proved to be finite? That void which was most evidently hastening here...?

They are wont to say that, ever since the Big Bang, our universe has been expanding. However, Karl was wondering... into what, specifically, was it expanding? Into what environment? Or had the universe started contracting again, perhaps... and was that precisely what had been taking place every day, slowly but surely?

To begin with, Karl had still hoped that, paradoxically, infinity... despite the fact that it was, by nature, boundless... might, however, be a *sui generis* containment of nothingness. Unfortunately, it was becoming evident that nothingness was consistently prevailing.

“Oh, well,” he muttered to himself, “as the philosopher said, ‘I think, therefore I am a joke’.”

He decided to try and evaluate the losses that had arisen thus far, to find out something beyond conversations with scientists... never mind whether they were devoted to the spirit or to the material... something beyond the results of observing the town or watching television. So he gave some thought as to whether he’d \[Ihead for the nearest church\] or, perhaps \[Jmake his way to the Municipal Offices, the seat of the Town Council\].

I

Only a few weeks earlier, the church had been part of an entire group of buildings. Now it stood there, a solitary edifice in the wilderness... and, a dozen or so metres beyond it, the world ended. Literally. Karl absorbed that discovery with astonishing composure. He walked gingerly over to the end of the world. Just as, behind him, the day held sway, with the scrap of the Sun that still remained shining in the sky, so now, suddenly and without warning, in front of his eyes, spread the sable black of outer space, with no more than a meagre handful of stars scattered here and there. The ground broke off along one and the same line, but Karl didn’t dare lean out over the edge, because he suspected that there’d be no atmosphere on the other side, to say nothing of the deadly temperature. It didn’t matter all that much to him whether it was 180 degrees Celsius or even absolute zero; he had no desire to experience it at first hand for as long as that proved possible... especially when his supposition was lent credence by the stone he threw at the end of the world for experimental purposes. Once it had crossed that incredible border, it no longer flew in an arc, but in a straight line, without slowing down, majestically moving further and further away until it finally disappeared into what had once been called interplanetary space.

The side chapel in the church was empty, dark and silent.

“Hello?\!” Karl called. His own voice seemed spectral to him in the silence and a long, drawn-out echo drifted through the space, sending a chill up his spine. “Is there anybody here?”

A distant sound drifted towards him and then, from behind a row of columns, a priest emerged in the side nave.

“Welcome, my son. I’m the parish priest. How can I help you?” His voice as he spoke was mellow.

Karl wasn’t an overly pious man. He’d read a large enough portion of the Bible to know that, if he read the whole thing, he’d undoubtedly lose his last vestiges of faith. He studied the parish priest, who was a man past his prime, but in good shape for all that, with his luxuriant head of silver hair and liturgical robes giving him a look that was almost dignified.

“Are you seeking God, my son? A service will be starting quite soon. Would you care to join us?”

“You know, Father... I think that, if some Higher Entities were to create some intelligent beings as an experiment, but programmed them in such a way as to reach their aims by the most difficult paths possible, without perceiving any of the obvious solutions, then the final outcome would be human beings. Us. In general, people prefer not to see the truth. Instead, they immediately create a prosthesis of it and only then act on the basis of that. In my case, I think it’s like this, that maybe I do believe in God... but do I believe God...?

“So what is it you want?” The parish priest’s tone was now chilly.

“I... I’m writing an article on the subject of... er... the Roman Catholic Church... is it always this deserted? Would it be possible to know how many faithful there are in the parish?”

“Ever since I have been serving here, and that will soon be seventeen years, our community has been composed of Mr Morgenstern.” The priest’s chasuble rustled with every move he made.

“Has been composed of...” Karl strove to comprehend the odd syntax. “Father, are you telling me that, for seventeen years, you’ve been celebrating Mass for one person? Doesn’t that strike you as strange?”

“I don’t understand what your concern is,” the priest responded matter-of-factly. “It is, after all, a perfect and natural image of the dualism of God and humankind. That truth was also proclaimed to us by the Lord Jesus Christ and His Apostle. Since you’re writing an article, sir, you should be more familiar with the Testament.”

“I’d be interested to know which one,” Karl muttered. The priest stared at him in astonishment.

“What do you mean, ‘which one’? Is this some kind of blasphemous joke?\! There is only *one *Testament\!”

Karl left the chapel without uttering a word.

He stood outside the church for a moment and wondered what else he might, in fact, do. To be sure, \[KProfessor Benedikt, the last of the scientists Karl had consulted about his books\], was an eccentric old man... providing the venerable scholar still existed, that is..., but it looked as if all the other options had now been exhausted.

Before he walked off, Karl gazed once again at the bottomless blackness barely a few feet away. He'd heard that a person standing on a precipice sometimes has an incomprehensible urge to jump. Perhaps he should take the rope that hung from the bell in the church tower and try \[Lto investigate what lies beyond the end of the world\]... ? ‘Leap from Earth into outer space... this might be the only chance,’ he mused. ‘Since the air isn’t escaping from the terrestrial atmosphere over that extraordinary border, maybe there’s some kind of atmosphere on the other side...?’ The idea was insane, but couldn’t the same be said of everything that had happened in recent weeks?

L

The length of the bell rope was quite impressive. Karl bound one end round his waist and tied the other end firmly to a solitary tree growing nearby. He stood above the dark abyss. The few remaining stars twinkled at him encouragingly. With a violent movement, he thrust a hand into the abyss... and snatched it back just as rapidly. He hadn’t felt a thing, no temperature difference at all. Still, he was hesitant. He realised that the world was ending, so it would be worth absorbing, in one last, despairing gulp, the unfathomable knowledge that his mind, for which time was most probably running out, thirsted for. He also knew that, in truth, the world had ended for him much, much earlier... when he’d lost Judith. At that thought, he felt a painful wrench in his chest. Without reflection, he leapt from the edge of Earth and into space...

...... but he didn’t fall downwards. Even though the prevailing temperature around him was bearable and it was also possible to breathe, Karl was floating in a weightless condition. ‘Ah, right,’ he thought. ‘Another law of physics has vanished, too. Bearing in mind the nature of what’s happened in recent weeks, I won’t be surprised if I bang my fucking head on the dome of the firmament.’ The woodcut in Flammarion’s book had popped into his mind.

He turned round and looked at Earth receding behind him. He had to admit that, despite the appalling context, the view was incredible. There it was, spreading out from left to right in the midst of the pitch-black void... the world. No matter that it was almost deserted; it was still visibly illuminated and covered with vegetation; from this distance, it was possible to make out the sparse scattering of buildings and the people who’d survived meandering between them without having even the foggiest idea about the extraordinary phenomenon that lay no more than a stone’s throw away. To simplify to a monstrous degree... it looked rather like a panoramic photo of a landscape mounted in the centre of a huge sheet of black cardboard.

Then, suddenly, Karl noticed that more sections of land were beginning to recede and vanish... and, as a result, the tree he’d fastened the rope to had also disappeared and the rope was now drifting slowly through space. An animal terror swept through him. He thrust desperately with all his limbs, as if he thought that he could ‘swim’ back to Earth, and instinctively started hauling himself along the rope, still ludicrously expecting that, by some miracle, this would bring him back to the edge of the world.

Fear settled in his mind. He knew that, since he was neither suffocating nor freezing, what awaited him now were long days of dying in the midst of nothingness.

Karl drifted away \[1into the boundless darkness and boundless despair\].

J

On the way to the municipal offices, Karl was struck with terror when he noticed that, here and there, the ground had opened up into sprawling holes that gaped onto a black void. He presumed that, at the very least, certain laws of physics weren’t functioning in those sable regions, since objects large and small were floating there... sticks and stones, but also paving stones, street lights and other elements of the town’s infrastructure. There were birds or insects above some of the holes, desperately flapping their wings in an ineffective attempt to get away and take flight. It looked as if a state of weightlessness held sway both inside the holes and above them.

Karl carefully avoided these anomalies and slowly headed towards his destination. He had no taste for contact with the authorities and their representatives. His spirit was more that of an anarchist. In his view, the state as an institution had the nature of an organised crime outfit; it extorted money from people and, in return, offered them services in name only... like the illusion of protection, for instance, this primarily being protection from the state itself, which, just like organised crime, harasses and persecutes those who don’t want to pay. 

The municipal office building was still there, although the structure hadn’t remained untouched. The main entrance lay to the left, but one of the great, black holes had opened up in the earth to the right and so the entire section of the building that had stood on that spot had vanished. The impression this gave was as if a ravenous giant had bitten out a chunk of it... the structure of the interior walls, the floors and various rooms was visible from afar. Even the handful of remaining employees could be seen, wandering around the rooms without the slightest awareness of the singularity of their situation. 

Once Karl went into the building, it turned out that there were even more black holes inside. These were smaller and the clerks making their way hither and thither walked round them with a display of uncommon indifference, to say nothing of agility. Karl was delighted to note the fact that the head of the Population Records and Identity Papers Department still existed. He was a middle-aged man, rather unkempt and more disadvantaged than blessed by Nature when his genes were drawn from the pool.

“... that is correct,” he said. “We hold the records of every birth and death. At present, our metropolis has fifty-four residents.”

“Fifty-... four?” Karl actually choked on the words. “Don’t you have the impression that’s really rather a small population for a... metropolis?”

“I don’t quite follow your meaning. I don’t see anything in the data that departs from the norm.”

“You public servants never notice anything that’d be inconvenient for you,” Karl muttered to himself. However, it seemed he hadn’t spoken as quietly as he thought, because the head of department looked at him askance.

“You’ve no great liking for us, eh?” he asked. “Maybe you’ve got something to hide from the authorities...?”

“Ah, you see\! Suspicion raises its head after an exchange of just a few sentences. No, I don’t like you. And I’ll tell you one thing. Just imagine this; one person shoots another with a firearm and the person who’s been shot simply dies. And now imagine that one person grabs a big, thick, heavy stick and beats another person up with it, battering that person’s head, their torso, their legs, their genitals, beating them mercilessly, on and on. And, as a result of that unimaginable, interminable torture, the person who’s being beaten finally dies. And now, would you kindly explain just how inhuman, how downright diabolical the legislation must be when assault and battery resulting in a death is treated more leniently than a murder committed on the spot?\! This is not the law – it's the codified lawlessness\!” Karl was genuinely shaking. He had the impression that he couldn’t count on help from anywhere now.

“But anarchy inevitably leads to tyranny in the end,” the philosophical official said. Then he added, “And after what you’ve just been yelling here, I’m seriously considering whether or not I should report you to the police. You might represent a danger. The fact that you’re in a very poor mental state is clear to the naked eye.”

“Go on then, report me\!” Karl snarled and marched out of the building. He stood in the midst of the wasteland outside for a moment and wondered what else he could do. Professor Benedikt, the last of the scientists Karl had consulted about his books, was an eccentric old man, to be sure... providing the venerable scholar still existed, that is..., but it looked as if \[Kall the other options had now been exhausted\]. 

K

It has to be admitted that Karl felt an overwhelming desire to go home and drink himself to death... or, at any rate, to try with all his might to do so. However, it turned out that there was now no possibility of heading that way on account of an enormous black hole in reality. The dark chasm was approximately the size of a sports stadium. There were more and more of them opening up at random. Willing or not, Karl set off to meet the professor.

When he arrived, he saw that an entire group of buildings had so far survived in this part of the town... and that Professor Benedikt’s was one of them. The scientist didn’t answer the door, so after repeatedly ringing the bell and knocking, Karl pressed down on the handle. The door yielded with a dismal creak. 

Inside, darkness reigned. The interior was cold. The power station had undoubtedly vanished by now, while the Sun was evidently slowly coming to the end of its life. The ancient scholar was sitting, motionless, in a rocking chair, a blanket covering him. He was staring at the television screen. The television was turned off. Karl went over to the old man and touched his shoulder.

“Professor...?”

The scientist twitched. It was clear that he hadn’t even noticed his visitor until now. He seemed utterly distracted.

“I’ve been wondering...” he said, still staring at the television screen, “...what that item of furniture could be for. I have the feeling that its function is ornamental, but... I can’t call the details to mind... Oh, well, old age is probably setting in.”

Karl had to devote a good fifteen or so minutes to getting Benedikt to return to his senses. He did everything he possibly could to haul his mind back to reality. As he was talking about the events of recent weeks, he constantly cast nervous glances through the window... he had the impression that the house was now standing on a small island amidst a sea of absolute blackness.

“Do you know the theory of the infinite number of worlds?” asked the Professor, who had finally managed to concentrate.

Karl shook his head wordlessly.

“Y-e-e-e-s...” the old man muttered, half to himself. “It was proposed, back in the day, by Hugh Everett III, in the context of the principles of quantum mechanics. Reality is multiplicity. Infinite multiplicity gives an infinite degree of complexity... From what you’ve said... even one reality was put together in a way that was unimaginable to us, to say nothing of an infinity of them. And what if they’re purely potential in nature? Then there’d be only one point of the present and it would move obdurately forward in line with the passing of time. Choices are made, decisions are taken and events... are established, described, confirmed, as it were, by the decisions we make...” 

“I don’t quite understand what that’s got to do with...” Karl began, but the venerable physicist interrupted him with an impatient gesture.

“Consider... what would go on with all those potential realities which have never come into being because such-and-such decisions or other such such-and-such decisions haven’t been taken? What happens to stations... if you’ll forgive an old man a paltry parable... which no ‘train of the present’ has ever passed through or will ever pass through in the future?”

Karl was now starting to see where the conversation was going... and he didn’t like it one bit. Benedikt must have spotted this, because he continued in a far livelier manner and with a kind of morbid satisfaction.

“If what’s happened is as you’ve described it, then it means that reality was a creation of well-nigh infinite complexity. It could be assumed that a system of such great complexity doesn’t vanish all at once. Particularly when trillions of similar creations are vanishing right alongside. I think that, in this case, decay and disappearance would require time. And that is, perhaps, what you can see... you’re observing, with a certain delay, the fact of the unbirth of our version of reality.

“But...” Karl was barely able to choke out a single word, “...in that case, why is it only me who can see the degradation of the universe?”

“Who knows...?” The old man thought for a moment. “It might have happened in that way because it was one of your decisions that led to the present heading along a different track from the one we’re on.”

Aghast, Karl thought back to the day when it had all begun. To the day when he’d decided to give his relationship with Judith another chance. Now he could see what That Other Karl had decided. He’d walked out. He’d left her.

He suddenly felt an extraordinary sense of peace. He was finally done with fighting, with running around in circles. He had long since realised that his world had no *raison d’être *without Judith. He knew that, even though The Other’s world existed, without her, it would be as empty and dark as the emptiness and darkness that would soon fall here. ‘It could be said that, in a way, accounts have been settled,’ he thought, without a shadow of emotion. Well, who knows, perhaps emotions had ceased to exist, too? 

In the meantime, Benedikt was continuing his cogitations.

“It’s not inconceivable that we’re living in a mirror image as the light is dying. In what might have been... yet didn’t happen. *In* borrowed time. Perhaps, indeed, the time has come to pay back the loan. We think that we *are*, yet, in truth, we’re merely after-images, the effect of the universe’s inertia. If that’s the case, then we won’t even know when our universe ceases to exist... And that could happen at any momen<span id="anchor"></span>

Only a few weeks earlier, the church had been part of an entire group of buildings. Now it stood there, a solitary edifice in the wilderness... and, a dozen or so metres beyond it, the world ended. Literally. Karl absorbed that discovery with astonishing composure. He walked gingerly over to the end of the world. Just as, behind him, the day held sway, with the scrap of the Sun that still remained shining in the sky, so now, suddenly and without warning, in front of his eyes, spread the sable black of outer space, with no more than a meagre handful of stars scattered here and there. The ground broke off along one and the same line, but Karl didnÉt dare lean out over the edge, because he suspected that thereÉd be no atmosphere on the other side, to say nothing of the deadly temperature. It didnÉt matter all that much to him whether it was 180 degrees Celsius or even absolute zero; he had no desire to experience it at first hand for as long as that proved possible... especially when his supposition was lent credence by the stone he threw at the end of the world for experimental purposes. Once it had crossed that incredible border, it no longer flew in an arc, but in a straight line, without slowing down, majestically moving further and further away until it finally disappeared into what had once been called interplanetary space.

The side chapel in the church was empty, dark and silent.

ÄHello?!Å Karl called. His own voice seemed spectral to him in the silence and a long, drawn-out echo drifted through the space, sending a chill up his spine. ÄIs there anybody here?Å

A distant sound drifted towards him and then, from behind a row of columns, a priest emerged in the side nave.

ÄWelcome, my son. IÉm the parish priest. How can I help you?Å His voice as he spoke was mellow.

Karl wasnÉt an overly pious man. HeÉd read a large enough portion of the Bible to know that, if he read the whole thing, heÉd undoubtedly lose his last vestiges of faith. He studied the parish priest, who was a man past his prime, but in good shape for all that, with his luxuriant head of silver hair and liturgical robes giving him a look that was almost dignified.

ÄAre you seeking God, my son? A service will be starting quite soon. Would you care to join us?Å

ÄYou know, Father... I think that, if some Higher Entities were to create some intelligent beings as an experiment, but programmed them in such a way as to reach their aims by the most difficult paths possible, without perceiving any of the obvious solutions, then the final outcome would be human beings. Us. In general, people prefer not to see the truth. Instead, they immediately create a prosthesis of it and only then act on the basis of that. In my case, I think itÉs like this, that maybe I do believe in God... but do I believe God...?

ÄSo what is it you want?Å The parish priestÉs tone was now chilly.

ÄI... IÉm writing an article on the subject of... er... the Roman Catholic Church... is it always this deserted? Would it be possible to know how many faithful there are in the parish?Å

ÄEver since I have been serving here, and that will soon be seventeen years, our community has been composed of Mr Morgenstern.Å The priestÉs chasuble rustled with every move he made.

ÄHas been composed of...Å Karl strove to comprehend the odd syntax. ÄFather, are you telling me that, for seventeen years, youÉve been celebrating Mass for one person? DoesnÉt that strike you as strange?Å

ÄI donÉt understand what your concern is,Å the priest responded matter-of-factly. ÄIt is, after all, a perfect and natural image of the dualism of God and humankind. That truth was also proclaimed to us by the Lord Jesus Christ and His Apostle. Since youÉre writing an article, sir, you should be more familiar with the Testament.Å

ÄIÉd be interested to know which one,Å Karl muttered. The priest stared at him in astonishment.

ÄWhat do you mean, Çwhich oneÉ? Is this some kind of blasphemous joke?! There is only *one *Testament!Å

Karl left the chapel without uttering a word.

He stood outside the church for a moment and wondered what else he might, in fact, do. To be sure, [KProfessor Benedikt, the last of the scientists Karl had consulted about his books], was an eccentric old man... providing the venerable scholar still existed, that is..., but it looked as if all the other options had now been exhausted.

Before he walked off, Karl gazed once again at the bottomless blackness barely a few feet away. He'd heard that a person standing on a precipice sometimes has an incomprehensible urge to jump. Perhaps he should take the rope that hung from the bell in the church tower and try [Lto investigate what lies beyond the end of the world]... ? ÇLeap from Earth into outer space... this might be the only chance,É he mused. ÇSince the air isnÉt escaping from the terrestrial atmosphere over that extraordinary border, maybe thereÉs some kind of atmosphere on the other side...?É The idea was insane, but couldnÉt the same be said of everything that had happened in recent weeks?

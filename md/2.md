Karl preferred to avoid decapitation but, a few days later, something in particular began nagging at his thoughts. As follows; a painting had always hung on the wall in the guest room. A few smears of red on a yellow background, an object which Judith grandiloquently called ‚artƒ. It had hung there... until the previous Wednesday. Since then, the wall had remained empty.

Karl didnƒt miss the ‚work of artƒ, but it had to be admitted that the daub did have a certain market value. Besides this, he was astonished that not so much as a trace had been left on the wall. The picture had hung there for years, so there really ought to be a large, lighter patch. It was most odd.

He weighed up his options. Should he [3ask Judith about it], risking yet another clash, or would it be better to wait until the next day and [4talk it over with his brother]? Perhaps Anton would know something about it.

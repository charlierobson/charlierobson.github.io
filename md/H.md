Karl stood, helpless, in the deserted street and wondered what to do next. Everything seemed to be pointing to the fact that no one was capable of halting the annihilation. And in that case... what would happen now, what would actually remain once everything had vanished? The question fascinated Karl in a ghastly sort of fashion.

People are usually fascinated by the concept of infinity. They find it mind-boggling that anything at all could be infinite. However, infinity had recently seemed to Karl to be something safe, if not to say downright familiar. This thinking sprang from the fact that, to him, infinity stood in opposition to the concept of the oncoming nothingness he had been observing. Not nothingness in the sense of the cosmic void, though, because even in that, some particle or other might be encountered. For, after all... how could *absolutely nothing *exist?

On the whole, scientists were engaged with what fills space. Maybe they should also have interested themselves in what is found in that ÇplaceÉ where our space is absent. The thought that the universe is infinite had never triggered fear, or even anxiety, in Karl. On the contrary... recently, that thought had seemed to calm, comfort and cheer him. He was able to comprehend a universe thus conceived of. Even if it were an infinite universe composed of smaller universes like ours. However, his hair stood on end at the very thought that, at some moment, the continuum of things would come to an end and that there was absolutely nothing beyond it. So what would that *absolute *void be? How was it going to be located beyond the world of things if that world actually proved to be finite? That void which was most evidently hastening here...?

They are wont to say that, ever since the Big Bang, our universe has been expanding. However, Karl was wondering... into what, specifically, was it expanding? Into what environment? Or had the universe started contracting again, perhaps... and was that precisely what had been taking place every day, slowly but surely?

To begin with, Karl had still hoped that, paradoxically, infinity... despite the fact that it was, by nature, boundless... might, however, be a *sui generis* containment of nothingness. Unfortunately, it was becoming evident that nothingness was consistently prevailing.

ÄOh, well,Å he muttered to himself, Äas the philosopher said, ÇI think, therefore I am a jokeÉ.Å

He decided to try and evaluate the losses that had arisen thus far, to find out something beyond conversations with scientists... never mind whether they were devoted to the spirit or to the material... something beyond the results of observing the town or watching television. So he gave some thought as to whether heÉd [Ihead for the nearest church] or, perhaps [Jmake his way to the Municipal Offices, the seat of the Town Council].

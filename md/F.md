Just in case, he took his pistol with him, which was most probably an irrational measure and gave him nothing more than an illusory sense of safety.

The land which had once been the town was now scarcely a built environment at all. It was almost completely deserted... Karl saw no more than three, perhaps four people along the way. Even though it was late morning, it wasnÉt at all light. A great, dark hole gaped in the Sun and expanded with each day that passed. Maybe the Sun was too large to vanish all at once...? The Moon had ceased to exist several days before and Karl had been thinking about how this would generally be affecting the tides or the equilibrium of the Solar System. In the end, though, heÉd come to the conclusion that since elements of reality were dematerialising, it wasnÉt inconceivable that the laws of physics were also vanishing one after another.

He reached his destination and went into the building, now solitary, but once a part of the metropolitan sprawl. He made his way slowly along an unlit stairwell. The silence was overwhelming. He pressed down on the handle of the door to the laboratory. It was unlocked.

The room was in disarray, saturated with a whole mass of smells on a spectrum ranging from unpleasant to repulsive. Amongst them, the odour that reigned supreme was something like a combination of ozone and the stench of burned plastic.

The voice was very faint, which is why Karl didnÉt hear it at all to start with. However, he knew there was another room here and from the other side of the door, which was currently hidden behind a stack of electronic scrap, came a quiet gibbering... incomprehensible words, repeated in an unbroken stream.

He shifted the pile of scrap and cautiously stepped into the room. He couldnÉt see very well in the darkness that surrounded him, but he had a sense that something was wrong... some of the furniture and objects were arranged at odd angles and gave the impression of literally permeating other pieces of furniture and other items. A man was lying on the floor, covered by a filthy blanket. He was facing away from the door and he was almost completely motionless apart from the febrile movement of his lips as his faltering voice repeated the same words, over and over again. Like a incongruous counting rhyme.

Karl slowly approached him.

...glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere, glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere, glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing everywhere...Å the recumbent figure gibbered without pause.

It was only after Karl had removed the blanket that it became clear that Doctor VloshinÉs experiment couldnÉt be numbered amongst the successful... and that he offered no promise whatsoever of salvation. He wasnÉt so much lying on the floor as inextricably integrated with it along the entire back half of his body. With his face turned upwards and his gaze utterly crazed, he was ceaselessly reciting his terrifying string of words in a voice growing steadily weaker.

Karl shot him and [Hquickly left the lab].

Evening came. Judith still hadnÉt gone to sleep. She was looking at something on the computer, lying on the bed, barefoot, wearing fairly tight-fitting jeans and a loose shirt. Karl sometimes wondered whether she dressed like that because she knew just how much the style appealed to him or if she simply did it because she was comfortable like that. Or, perhaps, for both reasons.

He was sitting in his desk chair, flanked by a small, sculpted lamp on one side and a glass and a half-empty bottle on the other. Bourbon was the only form of corn he would tolerate on the menu. He was trying to write something... anything at all... but, first and foremost, he was silently contemplating Judith. This wasnÉt only because, lying there in the pool of light cast by the night lamp amidst the dimness of the room, she was material for a painting or, at the very least, an excellent photo. It was also by way of the fact that she was the last anchor securing him in a state of relative mental equilibrium.

ÄHell, itÉs not coming, " he muttered, glaring at the sheet of paper.

ÄWhat?Å Judith asked, tearing her attention away from the computer. ÄIÉm sorry. I didnÉt catch what you said.Å 

ÄIÉm saying that itÉs stupid somehow. IÉm striving to digest a... recent event. IÉve called it *Trees on the Clouds*.Å

ÄOK, go on, read it, read it,Å she smiled, knowing that, as usual, this was his awkward way of seeking her help.

Karl cleared his throat and started to read, trying to convey the tone of his female narrator.

*I was making lunch when the doorbell announced that I had a visitor. It was him again. As always, heÉd come to tell me what heÉd dreamed about. We saw each other almost every day.*

*Ä... I was looking at the sky and I noticed that, in places, the clouds floating above me were covered in earth. In the sense of... soil, do you see? The wind carries earth onto the rocks, which eventually creates the conditions for plants to vegetate. Only here, it had carried it up to... the clouds.Å He laughed. ÄThey were overgrown with bushes and even with trees. It gave some of them an appearance almost like leafy, flying mountains. But I... you know how it goes in dreams... very slowly, I began to realise that, in fact, something was wrong here. I asked some passers-by, but they all claimed it was a normal phenomenon... that, of course, not only plant life, but also animals live in the clouds. I thought that, in that case, IÉd come across some kind of wonder in an alternate reality.Å*

*I laughed and said, ÄI think youÉve probably been reading a bit too much of that fantasy literature.Å*

ÄYou could well be right...Å he sighed.

*Every time, his dream was an extraordinary one. Once it was a world following an invasion by aliens, another time, it was travelling to various historical epochs via a common-or-garden kitchen door. On one occasion, he even described impressions of life on a cuboid planet. Then I always wondered why some people experience such wonders as they sleep, while others dream about buying bread at the grocerÉs shop. However, it was always some kind of unusual story that brought him to me.*

*And that was what our meetings were like; a time brimming with magical tales of the experiences of an intriguing man. Dream experiences.*

*One day, I noticed that he seemed somehow silent, changed in some way.*

*ÄHas something happened,Å I asked him, alarmed. ÄIs everything all right?Å*

*He didnÉt say anything for a long moment. Finally, though, he spoke.*

*ÄListen... I woke up this morning and... IÉve been walking around the town for several hours now... Looking around... And there isnÉt one... thereÉs not even one! I donÉt know... Where have the trees in the clouds gone?*

Karl finished reading.

ÄWhat do you think?Å he asked, raising his eyes from the text.

Judith wasnÉt there. He stared at the immaculately made, utterly empty bed. Then he leapt to his feet and searched every room in terror, leaving a veritable shambles in his wake. There wasnÉt a living soul to be seen. JudithÉs clothes... her toiletries... photos of the two of them... all missing. Not a trace of her remained except the memories held in his frenzied mind.

He had absolutely no idea what to do. He searched feverishly for his mobile phone and selected Anton's number from his speed dial. Ç*The number you have dialled does not exist*. *The number you have dialled does not exist.*É He disconnected. He didnÉt have a shadow of doubt about what that meant. There was no Anton now. He fell inertly onto the bed.

* * *

Almost two weeks had passed. He was drinking almost non-stop. He never went out. In fact, he barely even got out of bed. Mess and semi-darkness reigned in the house.

Loneliness undoubtedly makes itself felt differently in everyone. Karl identified it thanks to the television. In his opinion, you recognise loneliness by the fact that, when you go for a shower, youÉre frightened to turn off the television as you leave the room because youÉre scared of the space youÉll find when you come back later. Still and dark. Silent.

Karl never turned the television off.

First the number of programmes and presenters had diminished. And for several days now, thereÉd been nothing showing but the same two films.

Ä*...I want a nigger hidinÉ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*Å 

He opened another bottle, his movements unsteady, but he passed out after a few swigs. Several hours later, he woke up.

Ä*...I want a nigger hidinÉ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*Å

He struggled to his feet and, with difficulty, staggered to the toilet. The sound of a telephone ringing drifted from the room, but he was still extremely drunk, so he didn't make it back in time to answer the call. When he finally focused on the phone screen, he was astonished to discover that the caller was Doctor Vloshin. HeÉd left a voice message.

ÄCome round to my lab. I think IÉm on to something....Å But that was all there was. The words were followed by an explosion and a scream.

Karl collapsed into an armchair with resignation and mused at length over whether he should [Fhead over to VloshinÉs laboratory] or finish the bottle and not take any action... whatever it might be... until the next day. Or in a weekÉs time. [GOr whenever he acknowledged that it was of any consequence whatsoever]. 

Ä*...I want a nigger hidinÉ in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass...*Å

They made their way slowly toward the restaurant where Anton had arranged for them to meet his acquaintance, Anna Koenig, who was a doctor of theology and, at one and the same time, a militant creationist.

ÄIÉm really not convinced that this is the right track,Å Karl muttered as they walked along. ÄYou know what they say about all religious fanatics... to them, truth, understood as a description of an actual state, constitutes a personal affront.Å

ÄIt was you who said Çsince rational solutions have failed usÉ...Å

ÄYes, yes, I know. Very well, then.Å

They walked on in silence for a minute. Karl was trying to assess just how many elements of reality had now been subject to dematerialisation. The town was noticeably less densely built-up than it had been only the previous day. The traffic was practically indiscernible.

Finally, Karl turned to a new topic of conversation, chiefly in order to take his mind off his growing sense of fear for a moment.

ÄDo you know her personally? Can you go into any detail? How does she behave? What does she look like? SheÉs bound to take us for lunatics.Å

ÄAh, well, a tall, gorgeous redhead...Å

Karl gave his brother a suspicious glance.

ÄNot so long ago, your basic criterion for judging female beauty was ÇWhat a looker! Like something out of a porn flick!É...Å

ÄOf course. It still is. ThereÉs no reason to go changing an efficient system of evaluation.Å

ÄAnd youÉre surprised youÉre still single.Å

Anton shrugged.

ÄIÉm not surprised at all. IÉm not a child. I know very well that life can never compare to good cinema.Å

It turned out that Anna was already waiting for them and it became clear that AntonÉs description of her had been spot on, at any rate. It could even be said to have hovered on the borders of understatement.

Contrary to KarlÉs fears, she heard them out with genuine interest.

ÄI donÉt think that whatÉs happened to you is at all impossible or even unbelievable,Å she said once theyÉd finished. ÄBut then... what IÉm involved in is whatÉs known as Young Earth Creationism. We build our theory on the basis of a biblical interpretation whereby it is evident that our planet is less than six thousand years old... or nine, at the most. Earth, humankind and all life on Earth was created by God in six days. It was then that He made the basic forms of living organisms... the ÇbaraminsÉ or Çcreated kindsÉ. They donÉt originate from a common ancestor at all, as ridiculous evolutionary theory has it. More specifically... those baramins, those independently created *fauna *and *flora*, can change slightly under the impact of stimuli flowing from the environment, for instance, or as a result of various mutations, but only within a highly limited scope. And so I can assure you that monkeys and humans donÉt have a common ancestor... not at all.Å She smiled with such charm that, if Karl had been standing, his knees would have almost given way beneath him.

ÄIn that case, how do you explain species dying out?Å Anton asked. ÄLetÉs take the classic example of the dinosaurs.Å

ÄItÉs easy to explain by global catastrophes like the biblical Flood... and similar,Å Anna replied like a shot, brushing a curly lock of auburn hair away from her face with a subtle gesture which had Karl thanking his lucky stars that he was firmly seated on his chair.

ÄHowever,Å she continued, Äfirst and foremost, we maintain that the universe was created by God from nothing, in accordance with the principle of *creatio ex nihilo*. So itÉs not inconceivable that, at the end of the world, the universe could return to that *nihil*. Moreover, since it was created gradually, it might also cease to exist in the same way.Å

Karl and Anton immediately pricked up their ears.

ÄIn that case, whyÉs the phenomenon only being perceived by one person?!Å Anton enquired.

ÄGod is merciful. He could be shielding the fact that the Apocalypse is beginning from our eyes,Å Anna responded. Then, in an unusually calm and gentle tone, she added, ÄSince itÉs only your brother who can see the end approaching, heÉs undoubtedly GodÉs Prophet.Å

Karl experienced a sudden rush of heat. He felt that he had to get away from the table without further ado. He wanted to be alone for a minute, to gather himself together.

ÄExcuse me for a moment,Å he said. ÄI must just go and powder my nose.Å

He walked into the toilet, turned on the tap and immersed his hands and face in cold water. The world was spinning in front of his eyes. ÇProphet? What fucking prophet?!É he thought feverishly. ÇWhat apocalypse?! ItÉs sheer madness!É

When he returned to the table some ten or so minutes later, Anton was sitting there alone.

ÄWhereÉs Anna? Has she left? That quickly?Å Karl asked.

ÄAnna? What Anna?Å Anton looked genuinely alarmed. ÄAre you feeling all right? You walked off so suddenly. I mean, we arranged to meet here to decide how to proceed. WeÉre going to go into the Mandela effect and the cyberpunk sect in depth. DonÉt you remember?Å

Without so much as a word, Karl dashed out of the restaurant and [Dfled for home as fast as his legs would carry him].
